                <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                <p> Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. 
                    The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people 
                    living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love
                    with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left. Herds of elk and deer 
                    graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly
                    sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower
                    over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed. 
                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest
                    undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster,
                    and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are
                    good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate 
                    the late summer's slower, warmer water more. </p>

                <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
                <p> Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, 
                    the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone 
                    cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile
                    trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts 
                    outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic 
                    human activity, and great whitewater opportunities. Desolation is rated a Class II/III and
                    is usually done in 6 days Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  
                    This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells. </p>

                <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                <p> This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never
                    forget your visit to the Grand Canyon. Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class
                    whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience.
                    The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons 
                    and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river. CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a
                    unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10)
                    to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people 
                    are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both. </p>

    <h2>Ssewanyana Nicholas</h2>
    <p>I am Google-certified digital marketing professional. 
        I use innovative marketing and branding techniques
        to boost income, raise brand awareness,
        and strengthen customer relationships for small, medium, and large companies.</p>
    <p> I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in software development, and I'm currently
        single with no children. I am currently working as a freelancer for a 
        digital marketing solutions company. </p>
    <p>With this background, I've always wanted to create professional websites,
        and I'm excited to expand this skill set with other related technologies.</p>
    <p>I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and my 
        hobbies include chess, music, motorsport, and football. 
        I am also learning Chinese for fun.
